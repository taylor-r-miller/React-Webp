# react-webp
React hook for detecting if a browser supports webp.

Lightweight package for determining if a browser supports webp images. Particularly helpful in creating fallbacks for background images without having to download a package with a size larger than the savings a webp image can provide. Examples at https://github.com/taylor-r-miller/react-webp.
